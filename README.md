# hello-danger

This is a demo repository for DangerJS. Feel free to open PR to this repo. Keep the following in mind.

1. Changes in each PR (additions + deletions) should be **less than 50** to make it easier for the reviewer.
2. When defining functions with multiple parameters, use an object instead of multiple parameters. (Validation coming up soon)
3. Update the changelog for every change.

Happy coding!
